This is a OSU graduate level course fucusing on Computer vision and autonomous driving algorithm and technology. Self-motived undergrad and grad student are encouraged to enroll. Overall, I am supper nervous and somehow excited to see how it goes throughout this semester. I will keep update my progress on this research focus course every day and write a summary of the course goes every Wednesday.
